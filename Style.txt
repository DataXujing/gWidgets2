Style for programming:

gwidgets constructors: gedit, same for S3 methods
gwidgets handlers: addHandlerChanged (camelcase)
gWidgets methods: svalue (camel case, but nore really needed)
gWidgets arguments: use.toolbutton (a dot)

For the classes
gedit -> GEdit is class
methods use _: GEdit$add_handler_changed
arguments: use dots? XXX
