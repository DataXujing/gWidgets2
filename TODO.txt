* gfile -- how to set initial directory?
* Examples: ...


* selection_changed: gtext, gedit, gvarborwser, gtree, gdf, gtable
* Work on documentation
* vignette
* write examples into subdirectory (how to include then through dontrun?)
* work on tests

* connect to toolkit
* gfilter tied with gdf to replace subset.by
* gedit width
* ghtml
* svalue, addHandlerChanged -- document in each widget

* ghelp
* comment on deriving subclasses
* replace icons

Handlers
========

- glabel
  * is changed called for change (svalue) and clicked called for click
  event? (Right now the same)



DONE * http://glyphicons.com/glyphicons-licenses/ add these. (put
       directions in docs)
DONE * add in fixed arguments to filter argument of gfile.
DONE * Avoid gWidgets2RGtk2 in Suggests (Pre-compile vignette?)
DONE * install.packages check is slow
DONE * gstackwidget (notebook without tabs)
DONE * check class of widget on return (is(obj, "GButton"))
DONE * check_deprecated() deprecated_args=list("border"="This was removed,see $set_border")
DONE * guiToolkit rewrite
DONE * write asciidoc and html page for installing toolkit, check interactive and shos
DIDN'T WORK (CHARXE?) * Gabor's example of dispatch by overriding .Class in constructor
gbutton <- function(..., toolkit) {
  .Class <- class(toolkit)
  b <- nextMethod("gbutton")
  ...
}
and 
gbutton.guiWidgetsToolkitRGtk2 <- function(...) GButton$new(toolkit, text, handler, action, container, ...)
}
